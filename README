Originally this was meant to be a port to xcb of modern dwm however that proved to be quite the challenge so I gave up.

However someone with experience in xcb could likely do this with some effort, Though I dont know xcb enough to even "start this"

There is a port of dwm however it is outdated and can be found [here](https://github.com/julian-goldsmith/dwm-xcb)
