Originally this was meant to be a port to xcb of modern dwm however that proved to be quite the challenge.

instead I just changed the direction of the project and got the current version [xcb-wswm](https://github.com/DerjenigeUberMensch/xcb-wswm) which is a partial port.

However I strayed away from the "suckless" philosophy due to that lack of expandibility for that software without getting a huge mess of code.
